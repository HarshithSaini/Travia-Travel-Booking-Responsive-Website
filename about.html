         <h3>Alex</h3>
         <p>We have been so happy to use your service, easy to navigate website and very clear communication. Love the payment options (we used BPAY). We were kept up to date with emails and reminders. 
            We still have a trip to Fiji to take and currently looking at something for later in the year so you are obviously doing something right. Value for money on packages is also a factor, being a seasoned traveller I do a lot of research and Travelonline is running rings around other options. 
            Thanks for your work.</p>

         <p>Everything organised as promised- just a couple of things didn't realise we had a stopover in Adelaide so meant lots of getting off and on of planes as sister is from Victoria and me from Qld. 
            We decided to fly from Sydney when in hindsight should have opted to go straight to Adelaide had we known. And secondly did not realise Finns club was not at the same site as accommodation. 
            Perhaps a little more transparency would have been good. 
            All in all we hade a nice holiday. Thank you.</p>

         <h3>Denzel Washington</h3>
         <p>As a frequent traveller I found your package and service to be outstanding. The cost of the package was more than competitative. The choice of travel, accommodation and added trips were faultless.
             Compliments to those arranging the total package. I am hoping that a similar package is available in October this year. Can you please inform me of available options. Many thanks and again I appreciate your skilful packaging of this trip. 
             I would strongly recommend the use of services provided by Explore. As a senior gentleman their sevices were far more personal and appropraite for my needs than alternatives. 
             Perhaps you can inform me of your packages available in October 2013. Many thanks.</p>

         <p>I was really happy with my experience from Travel Online. When doing my research for good deals, I came across this site and although I had never heard of them, I was so happy I went with them for my booking!
            So easy and quick with the reservation and easy to customise your package!
